These are fun little experiments that originally started out as class projects to create some neural nets for classification and that ended up as more advanced conv nets for classifying dogs and cats (color and greyscale images), cgi generated hands showing rock, papers, or scissors, and fashion MNIST. These are simple classification problems since there are either not many target variables or the images are simple and low-res. I am uploading my notebooks if anyone stumbles upon this repo and wants to mess around with them a little bit with their own NN architecture, different image processing, etc.
