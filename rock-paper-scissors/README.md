For this problem, I worked with Tensorflow's rock-paper-scissors tutorial made by Lawrence Moroney https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/image/rock_paper_scissors.py, https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/rock_paper_scissors. The images used are cgi images of hands that are held out like rocks, papers, or scissors (like the game). The CNN in this case ended up pretty well with a relatively high validation accuracy. The model I trained is saved in this directory under rps.h5. Also, thanks to Lawrence Moroney again for the dataset and model: check out more of his work if you're interested http://www.laurencemoroney.com/.
