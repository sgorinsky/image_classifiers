This repo is a fun little experiment I did that started out as a class project to create some neural nets for classification and that ended up as more advanced conv nets for classifying dogs and cats. It's a simple classification problem since there are only two targets - cats and dogs. I made sure to upload all the final models and checkpoints associated with the notebooks. One issue I noticed is that the CNN i trained on the grey images of cats and dogs ended up with a significantly lower train and validation accuracy than the color one so it seems like my model architecture was better in that one. If anyone is interested, here are my note books and models.
